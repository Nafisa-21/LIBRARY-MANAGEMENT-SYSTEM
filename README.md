# RDBMS Library Management System

## Overview

**Library Management System** is a relational database project developed using Oracle SQL (PL/SQL). It simulates a real-world library system where users can borrow and return books or videos. The system supports three types of users: **Admins**, **Customers**, and **Employees**.

Admins have full control over the system, including user management and media inventory. Customers and employees can log in to rent or return media items and handle fines if they are late.
